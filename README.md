# Project Overview

This project contains multiple Python programs along with their corresponding unit tests.
All test cases follow best practices using the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) methodology.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Or using pytest:

```sh
pytest tests/
```

To run all tests using a single script from the `tests/` directory:

```sh
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```
